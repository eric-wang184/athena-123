A website that lets you do simple commands with your voice. 
Idea from talater/annyang. Their github is https://github.com/TalAter/annyang.

## Introduction
I started off wanting to do a speech identification project, using an API to figure out how to combine that with facial recognition on Iphones. However, I soon realized it was too complex to implement on my own personal laptop, so I switched the project to a speech recognition website. Using web dev and design and using my own commands, I turned the website more into a personal "Siri". 




### Result:
The result is four different commands. One is a math command that can do arithmetic. Another is a weather command that allows the user to find the temperature of a city using weathermap API. The weather command also comes with a map that zooms in to the city that the user wants to find the temperature of. There's also a joke command, using a dad joke API. Lastly, there is a timer command that pops up a window when the time is over.
